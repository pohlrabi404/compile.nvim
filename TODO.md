# Enhancement: A better way to handle project-scoped settings

There is currently no default way to handle project-scoped settings,
so this pull request is aiming for a more stream-lined way to handle
that.

## Current TODOS
- [ ] Having a local lua config file that returns a settings table that overrides the default ones
- [ ] Generate a file with proper documentation so that user can easily check which functionalities are available
